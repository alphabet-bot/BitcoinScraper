This is a powerful tool that generates bitcoin seeds and the send requests to the blockchain to check the wallets balance onece the balance is positive the wallet info will be saved to a file called seeds_with_balances .
DONT modify the time interval between the requests as the blockchain will not be  able to handle the amount of the requests and will have ERRORS .
